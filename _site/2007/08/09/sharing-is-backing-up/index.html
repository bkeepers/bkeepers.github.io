  <div class="body"><p>In my usual fashion, I put iTunes on shuffle after checking my email and headed for the shower. I had just finished brushing my teeth when the music quit mid-track.  &#8220;Weird, it hasn&#8217;t done that since before I upgraded to 2GB of <span class="caps">RAM</span>&#8221;, I murmured.  I went to inspect and found that my Mac was frozen solid. &#8220;Even more strange…not even the spinning beach-ball of death.&#8221; After a hard reset, I was left with a blank gray screen. I knew it couldn&#8217;t be good.</p>
<p>A day full of target disk mode, failed attempts to repair with Disk Utility, and a purchase of DiskWarrior later, I was pretty certain the hard drive was dead. 10,000 km (6000 miles for the metrically-challenged) and 6 weeks away from my last backup, I started taking an inventory of everything that I had lost.</p>
<p>Being the first time that I had really gone anywhere cool since I owned my digital <span class="caps">SLR</span> camera, I took a lot of pictures while on my <a href="/2007/6/19/working-in-israel">6 week trip</a>. Those photos were probably my favorite &#8220;souvenir&#8221;, and they were all gone! At least, that was my first thought, and then I realized that I had most of them on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers">Flickr</a> for friends and family to see what we were up to. I still had about 2 weeks of photos that I hadn&#8217;t uploaded yet (due to a painfully slow Internet connection), but it could have been worse.</p>
<p>Continuing through the inventory, it quickly became apparent that I really didn&#8217;t lose much. We use Subversion for all of our work projects, so all of that is on a server. I had just converted to <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, so I didn&#8217;t need to worry about losing feeds. I use <span class="caps">IMAP</span> for all my email accounts, so my mail was safe.  I use <a href="http://del.icio.us/bkeepers">del.icio.us</a> with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">Firefox extension</a> for my bookmarks. Most amazing to me was, thanks to last.fm, I can even see the <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/bkeepers/charts/?charttype=recenttracks">last song I listened to</a> before my hard drive crashed (Ani DiFranco, this is all your fault!).</p>
<p>After I returned home, purchased a new hard drive, and began the restoration process, I was struck at how inconsequential the data on my hard drive really is. Simply sharing the things that are important is a way to back them up. That being said, I would have really been at a loss had I not made a full backup before I left for my trip. I would have lost all the digital junk that I haven&#8217;t shared: old photos from before I started using Flickr, fragments of random blog posts that I started and never finished, and probably most importantly, my music collection.</p></div>
