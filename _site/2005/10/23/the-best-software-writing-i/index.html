<p>I have never been a big fan of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a>.  Some of his writings seem to be a matter of simply stating the obvious.  However, truely great thinkers have a way of a way of understanding the obscure and explaining it as if it were common sense.  So, my impressions of him may just be a misperception. This book did give me a better impression of him.</p>

The goal of the book is to encourage good writing from a genre of people that are proficient at writing in languages that a computer understands, but are incapable of writing anything slightly interesting for humans.  When I picked up the book, I had only heard heard of one or two of the authors.  But since reading the book, I now consume the blogs of many of them.  I was somewhat disappointed by the abundance of people involved in &#8220;corporate&#8221; software development.  It would have been nice to see more people involved in free and open source software, or those with a good perspective on the industry.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t know that I would consider some of them <em>&#8220;the best&#8221;</em>, most of the articles were quite enjoyable and the rest were at least tollerable.  This is the first book that I have actually read cover-to-cover for a while, so that itself says something.  There are articles to entertain anyone that is slightly interested in software development; suits or techies.</p>
<p>Overall, this book was a little disappointing after the first few articles.  The hard part about a book like this is that it is difficult to provide a climax and a resolution.  The articles are good from the onset and don&#8217;t really get any better.  But I do look forward to the second installment.  It is important to keep a finger on what is going on in the industry, and this book provides a great insight into the minds of some of those in the trenches.</p></div>
