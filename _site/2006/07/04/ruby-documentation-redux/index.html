  <div class="body"><p>Apparently, in my attempt to help eliminate comment spam, I managed to disable comments from users that are not logged in (which, doesn&#8217;t work too well when I have registration disabled).  I received a few responses to my <a href="/2006/07/03/ruby-documentation/" title="Ruby Documentation">previous post</a> via email, so I thought I would mention them and expand upon my frustrations with Ruby documentation.</p>
<p>Aníbal Rojas emailed me to point out <a href="http://www.rubymanual.org">rubymanual.org</a>.  This looks like a pretty good site, but seems to still suffer from the shortcoming of only having the core Ruby documentation and not the extensions from Rails or any other gems.</p>
<p>David Felstead emailed me to point out the <a href="http://widgets.precisionis.com.au/">Ruby RDoc Dashboard widget</a>. This is a handy little widget, but still isn&#8217;t a solution that I like.  One shortcoming I think it has (correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) is that it appears to use the RDoc from the internet, and not the local machine.  I&#8217;ll explain more of why this is a problem for me in a minute.</p>
<p>For a while I was using <code>ri</code> from the command line, and one thing I liked about that is that I could easily import documentation by running <code>rdoc --ri /path/to/src/lib</code>.  So I ran that on most of the gems I used frequently, including Rails.  What I didn&#8217;t like about <code>ri</code> is that I couldn&#8217;t easily jump around the documentation.  I could look up <code>ri ClassName</code> to find the method in the class that I was looking for, but then to get more info about that method, I had to exit, and type <code>ri ClassName#method</code>.  The other problem is that it would occasionally generate exceptions, especially in cases where a library or class would redefine a method. I never took the time to debug it, but usually deleting the <code>.rdoc</code> directory in my home directory, and re-running <code>rdoc --ri</code> fixed it (yes, the Windows equivalent of a reboot).</p>
<p>Before I switched to TextMate, I used the <a href="http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/">Ruby Development Tools</a> plugin for Eclipse, and one thing I really liked about that was the built in RI browser.  I could search through all the RI docs and easily find the methods I was looking for.  This is what I wished the Dashboard widget allowed me to do. The down side is that using <code>ri</code> on the back-end causes the problem with exceptions that I described above, and it was really slow on the Mac (didn&#8217;t seem to have that problem when I was running Linux though).</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s my wish-list for a documentation system in Ruby, in order of importance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>merge core Ruby docs with installed gems and other libraries&mdash;including redefined or added methods, which would probably require some type of environment awareness (not a problem for Rails apps)</li>
    <li>linked cross-references</li>
    <li>searchable</li>
    <li>fast</li>
