[@robbyrussell](http://twitter.com/robbyrussell) shared the [story of how Oh My Zsh came to be](https://medium.com/@robbyrussell/d-oh-my-zsh-af99ca54212c#.nw0anv9wq), and then went on to share some great advice:

> While I have many stories to share (and intend to write more on this topic), I wanted to speak to those who have been debating the idea of open sourcing a project.

> Don’t start with a wildly ambitious goal…
>
> Don’t try to account for every scenario…
>
> Don’t try to make it perfect…
>
> Don’t try to be everything to everyone…
>
> Don’t stop thanking contributors…
>
> Don’t forget the documentation…
>
> Don’t forget about the rest of your life…
>
> Don’t forget to have some fun…

I been a huge fan of [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for many years and often get complimented on my theme (I use the [agnoster](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#agnoster) theme).
