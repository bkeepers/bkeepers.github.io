title: Governance and open source infrastructure

There has been a lot of discussions this week following the [NPM dispute](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm) about what the community should/shouldn't be doing. While I agree with most of what has been said, I think there's a deeper issue that hasn't been explored here:

_Open source infrastructure–like GitHub and Node–lacks an adequate model for open source governance._

"Governance" is a fancy word for: who makes decisions, how are those decisions made, and how do actions based on those decisions get carried out? It is especially important when we're dealing with shared resources, like land, air, the crap we take out of or put into the land or air, and money. We are most familiar with the concept from our national governments.

But "governance" can apply to things besides nation states. My childhood home had a two-party system that created and enforced the policies that governed our land, money, and citizens. This system was ruled by my mom who weilded most of the power, including the ability to unilaterally create new policies, enforce law and order, rule on disputes amongst the citizens, and imprison anyone on a whim. My dad technically had veto power over everything, but he rarely exercised it due to the fear of political repercussions. None of this was written in law books, but there was an inherent governance system.

Governance is especially important when shared resources are subject to rivalry–what economists call _rivalrous_. If I can interfere with your use of a resource, then it is rivalrous. There are many ways governance deals with rivalrous resources, such as charing you to use them, penalizing you for abusing them, or assigning governance of specific things to others.

Property is a form of governance that assigns ownership as a way of dealing with rivalrous resources. You are given exlusive ownership of a resource, and it's up to you to decide who else can use it and what they can do with it.

Copyright is a form of _intellectual_ property. If I create something, I own it and am granted the right to control who can make copies of it.

Open source software turns this notion of copyright on its head, using a _license_ to grant anyone else the right to copy and use your software.  At this point, you still technically _own_ the copyright, but you've forfeited your rights to exclude people from using it. 

In [The Success of Open Source](http://amzn.to/1q5DS8G), Steven Weber explains it like this:

> The conventional notion of property is, of course, the right to exclude you from using something that belongs to me. Property in open source is configured fundamentally around the right to distribute, not the right to exclude. If that sentence feels awkward on first reading, that is a testimony to just how deeply embedded in our intuitions and institutions the exclusion view of property really is.
>
> Open source is an experiment in building a political economy-that is, a system of sustainable value creation and a set of governance mechanisms. In this case it is a governance system that holds together a community of producers around this counterintuitive notion of property rights as distribution.

By this point, the entire industry has a really solid understanding of the _sustainable value creation_ part of open source. Very few in the industry understand the _governance system_ part and the ramifications it has for distribution.

I'll revisit the _distribution_ part another day. Today I want dig further into the exclusion part because I think it is not well understood.

In Nadia Eghbal's post this week titled [There is no “my” in open source](https://medium.com/@nayafia/there-is-no-my-in-open-source-c3e5555390fa), she quotes a conversation that she had with Karl Fogel that looks at this notion of property from a diffent angle:

> We don’t have the right language to express when “my” indicates possession versus association. When we say: “that’s my bike” or “those are my shoes”, we mean that we own them. We have the final say in decisions about our bike. But when we say “that’s my father” or “my sister”, what we mean is we are associated with them. We obviously don’t possess them.
>
> In open source, you can only have “my” in the associative sense. There is no possessive “my” in open source.”

I think Karl properly frames this issue, but "my father" and "my sister" don't acknowledge the original property rights of the creator. I didn't create "my father" or "my sister". They were here when I arrived.

The more appropriate analogy here is "my child".

My parents begat me, bless their hearts, and had governance over me for many years. But because I was born into a larger system–these United States, the state of Iowa, and a community of friends–their power over me was limited. The nation doesn't permit them to kill me. The state doesn't permit them to abuse me. Their friends didn't permit them to deprive me. 

My parents created me. Their ability to procreate granted them limited governance over me, and it becomes even more limited as I get older.

This is the notion that I think our open source infrastructure is missing. A form of governance that acknowledges that once I share an open source project with the world, it is no longer "my" in the possessive sense, but "my" in the associative sense. I still have a role to play in helping to mature, but as it matures, it becomes less and less "my". Someday it will hopefully graduate, move out of my house, maybe go to a foundation, and become a part of a greater community.
