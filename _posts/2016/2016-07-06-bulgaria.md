Bozhidar Bozhanov reports [good news from Bulgaria](https://thepolicy.us/bulgaria-got-a-law-requiring-open-source-98bf626cf70a):

> Less than two years after my presentation titled [“Open source for the government”,](http://techblog.bozho.net/open-source-for-the-government-presentation/) and almost exactly one year after I [became advisor](http://techblog.bozho.net/a-software-engineer-as-a-high-level-government-adviser/) to the deputy prime minister of Bulgaria, with the efforts of my colleagues and the deputy prime minister, the amendments to the Electronic Governance Act were voted in parliament and are now in effect. The amendments require all software written for the government to be open-source and to be developed as such in a public repository.

…

> That does not mean that the whole country is moving to Linux and LibreOffice, neither does it mean the government demands Microsoft and Oracle to give the source to their products. Existing solutions are purchased on licensing terms and they remain unaffected (although we strongly encourage the use of open source solutions for that as well).
>
> It means that whatever custom software the government procures will be visible and accessible to everyone. After all, it’s paid by tax-payers money and they should both be able to see it and benefit from it.
