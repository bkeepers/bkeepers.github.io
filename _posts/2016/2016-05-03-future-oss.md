The [2016 Future of Open Source Survey Results](http://www.slideshare.net/blackducksoftware/2016-future-of-open-source-survey-results) are out. I found the [2015 results](http://www.slideshare.net/blackducksoftware/2015-future-of-open-source-survey-results/32-MOST_VALUABLEOPEN_SOURCE_PROJECTSECTION4TECHNOLOGYFUTUREOFOSSFUTUREOSS) to be a little more polished and insightful, but there are still a few interesting tidbits:

- 67% of companies surveyed actively encourage developers to contribute to open source
- 1 in 3 have a full-time person dedicated to working on open source
- 90% say open source improves efficiency, interoperability and innovation

There are still some challenges:

- 50 percent of companies surveyed have no formal policy for evaluating and choosing open source code
- Nearly 1/3 of companies have no process for identifying, tracking or remediating known open source vulnerabilities
