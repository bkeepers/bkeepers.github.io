I've been running Linux for a little over 3 years now. For the most part, it has been a very pleasant journey. Frustrating at times, but overall, pleasant.

I recently passed a major landmark: For the first time, in 3 years, I can do everything with my laptop in Linux that I was able to do with Windows! One of my biggest frustations as a mobile Linux user was the inability to suspend and resume. I've been reading about success stories from the hard-core Linux hackers for a while, but I've never actually been able to get it to work. In the past, I've gotten it to hibernate and resume in text mode, but X always seemed to cause problems. But, thanks to a little script called <a href="http://dagobah.ucc.asn.au/swsusp/script2/">hibernate</a> (not the Java ORM), and a wonderful guy named <a href="http://mhensler.de/">Matthias Hensler</a> who created RPMs and some nice <a href="http://mhensler.de/swsusp/">instructions</a>, my laptop is happily hibernating and resuming, all with a pretty little splash image.
