Maintaining an open source project is a lot like tending a garden. You can't just plant seeds and come back 4 months later to find a bountiful harvest. Open source software and the communities that create it are living organisms. As maintainers, our job is to create the right conditions for it to thrive, to water it, to protect it, to prune it, and eventually, with some work and a little luck, it will grow into the thing we intended for it to be.

This talk looks at what gardening can teach us about maintaining an open source project.
