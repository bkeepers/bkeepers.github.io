Did you know that GIFs have productive uses? Yep, [deal with it](http://media3.giphy.com/media/Nx2Lx1RmLadtC/giphy.gif)! Lately, I have been including [GIF screencasts on pull requests](https://github.com/bkeepers/github-notifications/pull/45) that include user interface changes as a way to clearly demonstrate the changes.

It's an extermely effective way to communicate what has changed. These screencasts have other uses, such as showing how to use a feature or demonstrating a bug.

There are a lot of ways to make a GIF screencast, but [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is the best tool I have found found. It is not the prettiest piece of software that I have ever laid eyes on, but it just works and makes fantastic GIFs. The GIF above is 26 seconds long, great quailty, but only 500 KB.
