"Collective Idea":http://collectiveidea.com would like to welcome "Brian Ryckbost":http://www.ryckbost.com/. Brian started as our first intern 9 months ago, and, even after putting up with crap from "Daniel":http://daniel.collectiveidea.com/blog and me, joins us today as a full-time employee. Congratulations, Brian, on graduating from intern to employee; you were the best intern we ever had!
