I came across a weird Safari bug today and couldn't find any other mention of it on the interwebs.  Here's the CSS and HTML to reproduce it:

<source:css>
dt {
  width: 200px;
  float: left;
}
dd {
  margin: 0 0 0 200px;
}
dd p {
  float: left;
}
</source>

<source:html>
<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>p1</p>
      <p>p2</p>
      <p>p3</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</source>

What's happening is that safari is adding a right margin to the @dd@, even though it is explicitly set to 0. Removing either the @float: left@ from the @dt@, or @position: overflow@ from the @dd@ (which is used to clear the floats) makes the right margin go away. Very odd.

My ultimate solution was just to add a @div@ inside the @dd@ that set @overflow:hidden@ to clear the floats.
