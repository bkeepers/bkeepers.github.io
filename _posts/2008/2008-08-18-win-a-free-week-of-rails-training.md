Want to learn Rails but can't scrounge up the cash for training? You can win a free spot at either our [Rails session starting next Monday, August 25](http://sessions.collectiveidea.com/ruby-on-rails), or to an advanced Rails session whenever it's announced.

All you have to do is [Complete this brief survey](http://tinyurl.com/advanced-rails-survey) about our upcoming Advanced Rails session. We'll be drawing a winner at 5:00 TOMORROW, August 19.

Also, we still have some spots available for our Rails session next week, so head on over to the [Sessions site](":http://sessions.collectiveidea.com/ruby-on-rails) to check it out.
