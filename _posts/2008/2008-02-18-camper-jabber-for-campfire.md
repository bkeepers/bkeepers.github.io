Jared Kuolt has put together a cool little app that [lets you use Jabber with campfire](http://superjared.com/entry/new-projects/#campfire_to_jabber). The app simply uses [Tinder](http://tinder.rubyforge.org) to listen in on a campfire room, forwarding messages on to a Jabber account, and posting any messages it receives from Jabber. Very cool.
