"Collective Idea":http://collectiveidea.com is hosting another "Ruby on Rails training":http://training.collectiveidea.com on August 25-28, 2008. Our training is a new take on training: it makes it actually enjoyable! If you're new to the Ruby world, or just want to get deeper into Rails, "check it out":http://training.collectiveidea.com.

The "last session":/2008/5/15/announcing-sessions-by-collective-idea was a blast. People flew in from Orange County, New York City and the Midwest. We had "pizza and beer":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2607529660/ at the "brewery":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2607531540/, "grilled":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2610513148/ on the "beach":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2609686549/, "played frisbee":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2609683175/ and "sand volleyball":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2609690223/, and of course, "learned":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2609675571/ "Rails":http://flickr.com/photos/bkeepers/2609675157/.
