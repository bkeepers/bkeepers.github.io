Git support in "Capistrano":http://capify.org 2.5 got a little lovin', but as a result, it may have broke your deploys.  By default, Capistrano now uses the @-q@ flag to tell git to not be so chatty.  But older versions of git (1.4.x and maybe some early 1.5.x versions) don't support the @-q@ flag.  If upgrading git isn't an option, the solution is simple.  Just tell Capistrano to take the muzzle off of git:

{% highlight ruby %}
set :scm_verbose, true
{% endhighlight %}
