Just a quick note to remind you that May 31 is the last day of early-bird pricing for the "Ruby on Rails training":http://sessions.collectiveidea.com. After Saturday, the price will go up from $1195 to $1495. (Who couldn't use an extra $300?)

If you're going to be at RailsConf, find "us":http://collectiveidea.com and get a discount code that gives you the early-bird price until June 6. We look forward to seeing you!
