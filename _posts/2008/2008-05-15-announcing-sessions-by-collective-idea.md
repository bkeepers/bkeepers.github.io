+**Update**: Daniel has a [great post that explains the idea behind the training](http://daniel.collectiveidea.com/blog/2008/5/15/sessions-by-collective-idea.+)

[We're](http://collectiveidea.com) really excited to announce [Training by Collective Idea](http://sessions.collectiveidea.com) on June 23-26. Come spend 4 days in Holland, Michigan, learning Ruby and Rails. Whether you’re a Ruby newbie, or want to get better, this training is for you.

The training features hands-on training by people who know Rails inside and out, and have taught Ruby, Rails, and Rails deployment across the globe.

In your free time, you’ll get to explore Holland’s unique downtown, the fantastic sand dunes of Lake Michigan, or talk to other Rubyists over drinks.
