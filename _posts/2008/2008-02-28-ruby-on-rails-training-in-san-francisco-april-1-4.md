I'll be leading another hands-on, interactive workshop exploring the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails in San Francisco on April 1â€“4. Experience the Rails way of approaching web applications, starting with the basics of Ruby and Rails, and then diving into the full Rails' MVC stack, testing techniques, Ajax and even web services. In the 4 day class, we'll work through the full life-cycle of a Rails project, giving you experience with all facets of a typical app, lead by people that have been working with Rails every day for 2 years.
