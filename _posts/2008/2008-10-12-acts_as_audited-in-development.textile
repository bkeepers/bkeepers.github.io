Thanks to "metatribe":http://github.com/metatribe, a huge annoyance in "acts_as_audited":http://github.com/collectiveidea/acts_as_audited is now fixed: it works in development mode.  Due to it's dependance on Rails' cache sweepers, which are only enabled when caching is, acts_as_audited didn't work in development mode.

metatribe has a "crafty solution":http://github.com/collectiveidea/acts_as_audited/commit/0f7bce2fec364762fef2662ee8abd72ab6be2672, which took me a few minutes to believe it would even work.  So "pull":http://github.com/collectiveidea/acts_as_audited the latest version and happy auditing.
