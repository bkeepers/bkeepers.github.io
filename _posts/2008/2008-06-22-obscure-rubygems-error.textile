A week or so ago my @gem@ command magically stopped working. Honestly, it was magic! There is no other logical explanation. The fetcher's socket marshaled all over, spewing this error:

<source:shell>
$ gem --version
1.1.0
$ sudo gem update --system
Updating RubyGems
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError)
    Hostname not known: gems.rubyforge.org (SocketError)
	getting size of http://gems.rubyforge.org/Marshal.4.8
</source>

Googling different parts of that error didn't yield anything useful. Lo, I post my solution in case some other poor soul has the same problem. Upgrade to 1.2.0.

Since @gem upgrade --system@ is broken, download the "rubygems-update":http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/38645/rubygems-update-1.2.0.gem manually.

<source:shell>
$ sudo gem install ~/path/to/rubygems-update-1.2.0.gem
$ sudo update_rubygems
</source>

Ah, all better. Oh, by the way, rubygems 1.2 rocks!
