"ecounseling.com":http://ecounseling.com, a project that we worked on at "Collective Idea":http://collectiveidea.com, is looking for a Rails programmer to implement some new features and continue to expand their site.

The site is a Rails application with lightweight CMS, live chat using Campfire, membership management and credit card processing. The client has been fantastic to work with, the problem is just that there aren't enough hours in the day. So we're looking for someone that is interested in full-time or consulting work. The client would ideally like around 40 hours/week, but I could contribute up to half of those.

Let me know at the email on the right if you're interested.
