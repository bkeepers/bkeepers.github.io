Three [Graticule](http://graticule.rubyforge.org) related updates:

1.  I released Graticule 0.2.2 this evening to fix a bug in the Local Search Maps geocoder.
2.  There is a new homepage for Graticule and acts\_as\_geocodable [over on RubyForge](http://graticule.rubyforge.org). Nothing fancy, but some basic docs with links to the RDoc
3.  I set up a [mailing list](http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/graticule-users) for anyone interested in making Graticule better or needing help. Head over, sign up, and tell me why Graticule sucks (or rocks, or sucks rocks).
