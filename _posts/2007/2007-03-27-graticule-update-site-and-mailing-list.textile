Three "Graticule":http://graticule.rubyforge.org related updates:

# I released Graticule 0.2.2 this evening to fix a bug in the Local Search Maps geocoder.
# There is a new homepage for Graticule and acts_as_geocodable "over on RubyForge":http://graticule.rubyforge.org.  Nothing fancy, but some basic docs with links to the RDoc
# I set up a "mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/graticule-users for anyone interested in making Graticule better or needing help. Head over, sign up, and tell me why Graticule sucks (or rocks, or sucks rocks).
