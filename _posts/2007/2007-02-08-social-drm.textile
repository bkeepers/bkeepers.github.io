bq. "Bill McCoy":http://blogs.adobe.com/billmccoy/2007/02/steve_jobs_elim.html: For eBooks, I really like the "social DRM" approach of "The Pragmatic Programmers":http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/, who "stamp" PDF eBooks with a "For the Exclusive Use of ..." and the name of the purchaser.

bq. So my challenge to print publishers and authors: why not support "social DRM", rather than heavyweight DRM?
