Several people have reported that acts_as_audited does not work with ActiveScaffold.  I don't use ActiveScaffold, so I had no motivation to fix it.  But thanks to a tip from "Aaron":/2006/7/21/acts_as_audited#comment-4569, this has now been fixed.

To make acts_as_audited work with ActiveScaffold, only enable auditing for only the @:create@, @:update@, and @:destroy@ actions.

{% highlight ruby %}
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  audit User, Thing, :only => [:create, :update, :destroy]
end
{% endhighlight %}

I'm not sure exactly why it breaks or why this fixes it, but from "this thread":http://groups.google.com/group/activescaffold/browse_thread/thread/a717fa3c8b7433a6 it sounds like ActiveScaffold just doesn't support polymorphic associations, which is what acts_as_audited uses to associated audits with models.
