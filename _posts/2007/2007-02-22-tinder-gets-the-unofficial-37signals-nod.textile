"Daniel Morrison":http://daniel.collectiveidea.com/blog pointed out to me this morning that "Tinder":/2006/12/8/tinder-campfire-api has officially attained "unofficial" status from 37Signals.

From the "Campfire":http://www.campfirenow.com/ site:

That's pretty exciting.  I'll blog in a couple days with more details on the project that I wrote Tinder for.
