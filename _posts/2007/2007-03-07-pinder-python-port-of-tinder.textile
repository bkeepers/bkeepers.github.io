"Lawrence Oluyede":http://www.oluyede.org/ has released "Pinder":http://dev.oluyede.org/pinder/doc.html, a Python port of "Tinder":http://opensoul.org/2006/12/8/tinder-campfire-api.  Very cool! We've been semi-conspiring to try to keep the feature set in sync. It would be cool if we could figure out how to standardize test cases, too.
