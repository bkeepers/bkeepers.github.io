I've committed a first pass at transcript support for "Tinder":/2006/12/8/tinder-campfire-api.  I don't really have an immediate need for it, so I'd love to get some feedback on how useful it is, and if there's other transcript features that are missing.

{% highlight ruby %}
dates = room.available_transcripts
transcript = room.transcript(dates.first)
transcript.first
#=> {:message=>"foobar!", :user_id=>"99999", :person=>"Brandon", :id=>"18659245"}
{% endhighlight %}

"Check out the source":http://github.com/collectiveidea/tinder and let me know what you think.
