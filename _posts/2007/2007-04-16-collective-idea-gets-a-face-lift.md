After months of good intentions^[1](#good-intentions^), we finally launched our [new website](http://collectiveidea.com) today.

We were aiming to have a simple site that gives a good idea of who we are and what we do while minimizing the "marketing fluff". We're really happy with the result. Check it out and let us know what you think.

Thanks to Brian at [ViewChange](http://viewchange.com) for his help with the design, and thanks to [Matt Slack](http://integernoun.com) for his CSS/XHTML wizardry. Check out [Daniel's post](http://daniel.collectiveidea.com/blog/2007/4/16/new-collective-idea-design) for more info about the new site.
