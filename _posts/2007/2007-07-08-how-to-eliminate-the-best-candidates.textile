From a "recent, very poorly written job posting":http://rubyrockstars.com/jobs/show/525:

bq. We need this done very quickly, in a matter of days

I am amazed at the number of job postings that have phrases similar to this.

*Employers: sounding desperate will only help you find desperate candidates*–those that need work immediately and are willing to put up with desperate clients. Anyone that has time to do your work immediately is likely short-changing their current clients (hint: you will eventually be the current client), or doesn't have any current clients–either of which should raise a red flag.

Take a deep breath and rewrite your job posting in a way that makes you sound like a professional. You'll get interest from a lot better candidates.
