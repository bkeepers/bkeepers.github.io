Good news for the Brits: "UK Geocoding Now Available in the Maps API":http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/07/uk-geocoding-now-available-in-maps-api.html.  This means that the Google geocoder in "Graticule":http://graticule.rubyforge.org should now work in the UK. I'm interested to hear how well it works from anyone using it.
