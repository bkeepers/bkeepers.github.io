"The Ringing Bell":http://theringingbell.com, the latest album from "Derek Webb":http://derekwebb.com, releases May 1. Derek has a reputation for being edgy with his counter-cultural message, but with this album he takes it one step farther. Even though the album doesn't release until May 1, you purchase the album online and "download MP3s of the album immediately":http://theringingbell.com.

This isn't Derek's first foray into edgy distribution models.  For 3 months, his previous album, "Mocking Bird":http://derekwebb.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=7013&inc=7&album_id=731, was downloadable for free at freederekwebb.com.

I have a ton of respect for Derek for his willingness to break the mold. I hope other artists and labels follow in his footsteps.
