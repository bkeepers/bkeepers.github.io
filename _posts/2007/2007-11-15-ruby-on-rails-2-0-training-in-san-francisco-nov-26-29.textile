I will be leading "another":/2007/7/18/ruby-on-rails-training 4 day Ruby on Rails course in San Francisco on November 26-29. Since "Rails 2.0 is almost out":http://blog.rubyonrails.org/2007/11/9/rails-2-0-release-candidate-1 (and may be by the end of the month), the training will be based on Rails 2.0, including the wonderful world of resources.

So whether you're new to Ruby and Rails and want to see what all the fuss is about, or you've been playing with Rails 1.x and want to see what 2.0 has to offer, head on over to "Marakana's website to sign up":http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html?a=collectiveidea.
