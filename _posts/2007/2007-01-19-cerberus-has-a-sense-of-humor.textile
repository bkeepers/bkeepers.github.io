bq. Build still broken and getting worse

Today Cerberus officially became my tool of choice for continuous integration when it sent me an email with that subject. I've been using "Cerberus":http://cerberus.rubyforge.org/ recently and I really like it. It's simple and it works, which is more than I can say for any other continuous integration tool that I've ever used.
