With all the chaos lately (trying to close on a house and traveling for a funeral), I forgot that Monday was an important milestone.  It has been one year since I joined "Collective Idea":http://collectiveidea.com.

It has really been a great year.  I get to work with one of the "most talented programmers I know":http://daniel.collectiveidea.com/blog, I get to use some of the "best tools":http://rubyonrails.org in the industry, I get to work on "a":http://tinder.rubyforge.org "wide":http://ecounseling.com "variety":http://graticule.rubyforge.org "of":http://centurydriving.com "projects":http://opensoul.org/projects, I can't ask for much more.

Looking back through my last year of blog posts (which, sadly, was less impressive than I expected it to be), it has been quite a ride.
