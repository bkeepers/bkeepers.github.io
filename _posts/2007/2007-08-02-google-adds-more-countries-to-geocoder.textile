Google has "added support for India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Ireland":http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/08/looking-for-somewhere-in-india-hong.html to their geocoder. If you're using "Graticule":http://graticule.rubyforge.org, it should Just Work(TM).  Let me know if you have any problems.
