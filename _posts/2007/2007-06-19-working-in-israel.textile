I think the biggest perk of working in this industry (and working for yourself) is that we can work from almost anywhere, as long as there's a connection to the tubes.

This summer, my wife is studying in Israel.  So, instead of staying home alone for 6 weeks, I decided to go along.  So far it's working out pretty well.  Although the view from my "office" isn't very exciting, as you can see:
