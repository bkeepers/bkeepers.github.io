Sadly, OS X +Tiger+ doesn't come with a way to create or open encrypted Zip archives, even from the command line (-hopefully this will change with Leopard- +if you have Leopard then you can skip the MacPorts part and just use the command at the end+).  The man pages for zip say that it supports it, but when you pass the <code>-e</code> or <code>-P</code> option, it complains:

<pre>
zip error: Invalid command arguments (encryption not supported)
</pre>

Fortunately, "MacPorts":http://www.macports.org/ (formerly DarwinPorts) to the rescue! There's a version of the command line zip utility in MacPorts that works as advertised.

"Install MacPorts":http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/macports/wiki/InstallingMacPorts, and install the new command line zip utility:

<pre>sudo port install zip</pre>

Move the old /usr/bin/zip out of the way, and then create encrypted Zip archives to your hearts content.

<pre>zip -re myarchive.zip mydir/
Enter password: ********
</pre>
