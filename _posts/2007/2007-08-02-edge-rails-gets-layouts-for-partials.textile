Edge Rails picked up a new feature today we've often longed for at Collective Idea. "Partials can have a layout":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7261:

{% highlight erb %}
<%= render :partial => "user", :layout => "admin", :collection => @users %>
{% endhighlight %}

This would wrap the user partial with the @admin@ layout, which in this example adds an edit link for the admin user:

{% highlight erb %}
<% content_tag_for :li, user do %>
	<%= yield %>
	<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_user_path(user) %>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

Another cool feature in this patch is the ability to add a layout to any block in a template, for those one-off situations, or to just tidy up repeated markup:

{% highlight erb %}
<% render :layout => "admin", :locals => { :user => owner } do %>
	<%= render :partial => "user", :collection => @users %>
  	(owner)
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}
