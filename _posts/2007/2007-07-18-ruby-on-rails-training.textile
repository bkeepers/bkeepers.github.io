I will be leading a 4 day "Ruby on Rails training course":http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html?a=collectiveidea in San Francisco on September 4-8 through Marakana.

From "Markana's website":http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html?a=collectiveidea:

bq. In Ruby on Rails Training course you will learn to put your web development on Rails using Test-Driven Development to create clean Ruby code that works, developing the confidence you need to fearlessly refactor and enhance your Rails application going forwardâ€¦Students will build a Rails application, learning the TDD lifecycle from the beginning. Time spent in lecture will focus on an introduction to Ruby, a thorough discussion of Test-Driven Development, and an in-depth exploration of the Rails framework, including a final day focused on using Ajax with Rails. The majority of the course will involve intense, hands-on learning to provide students with opportunities to encounter more realistic obstacles as they familiarize themselves with the rhythm of development on Rails.

If you can't make it to San Francisco in early September, or are interested in private training for your company/group from "developers with 2 years of real world Rails experience":http://collectiveidea.com, feel free to contact me.
