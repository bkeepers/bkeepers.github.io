<img style="padding: 1em; float: left" alt="Nokia 770 Internet Tablet" title="Nokia 770 Internet Tablet" src="http://www.nokiausa.com/images/phn/126x126/ph_770_lrg.gif" />From the moment I first heard about the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/770">Nokia 770 Internet Tablet</a>, I wanted one.  I don't remember the last time I was this excited about a gadget. Well, at Christmas I was fortunate enough to get one (thank you mom and wife!).

My experience with it so far has been very positive!  My main reason for wanting it is that I read a lot of material online and in PDFs.  I have a subscription to <a title="Safari" href="http://safari.oreilly.com">Safari</a>, and anytime it's an option, I buy the PDF version of a book instead of the hard copy.  For that, it has been great.  I can sit on the couch or lay in bed and read to my heart's content.

My only real complaint is in line with some of the typical criticisms of it: it's slow.  Some people complain that it's not worth $350.00 to check your email and read news.  First of all, it's extremely simple to install applications, so you can do a lot more with it than check email and read news (important things, like play games). And second, by saving $20 every time I buy an ebook instead of a hard copy, and taking better advantage of Safari, it will have been worth it in 6 months.

So it's been a good experience.  I haven't done any hacking on it yet, but sometime soon I hope to find time to install the updates and enable root access.
