<p>The <a href="http://gr-ruby.org/">Michigan Ruby Users Group</a> is hosting <a href="http://rubyconfmi.org" title="RubyConf*MI">RubyConf*MI</a> on August 26, 2006, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  It is shaping up to be quite a conference!  It will be a full day, single-track conference featuring well-known speakers David A. Black and Pat Eyler.</p>

<p>If you're in the region, spread the word! Registration will be $20, which is incredibly inexpensive for any conference.  It will be well worth it! (the free lunch alone is almost worth $20.)</p>
