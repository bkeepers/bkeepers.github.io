<p>Thanks to Michael Schuerig for pointing out that malicious users could unassociate your audit records due to the use of <code>has_many</code> in <a href="http://opensoul.org/2006/07/21/acts_as_audited/">acts_as_audited</a>. <code>has_many :audits</code> creates an attribute accessor called <code>audit_ids</code> on the model objects that you declare acts_as_audited, which could allow users to pass an array of ids that would overwrite the actual audit records.</p>

<p>This has been fixed by adding <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M000873"><code>attr_protected :audit_ids</code></a>, which protects it from mass assignment.  If you're not using SVN externals, make sure you <a href="http://opensoul.org/2006/07/21/acts_as_audited/">get the latest version</a>.</p>
