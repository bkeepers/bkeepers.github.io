Registration opened for <a title="Michigan Ruby Conference" href="http://rubyconfmi.org">RubyConf*MI</a> this morning.  The cost is only $20, which is insanely inexpensive for the caliber of speakers that are going to be there, plus it includes free lunch. You can't go wrong with that!

We've also been talking about the extra-curricular activities for the conference.  There will probably be some informal get-togethers on the Friday before the conference and maybe a Ruby "Hackfest" Saturday evening after, and we've been talking with David A. Black about <a href="http://dablog.rubypal.com/articles/2006/07/29/special-offer-for-ruby-users-groups-from-ruby-power-and-light">putting on a Ruby workshop</a>. This would be a great opportunity for people in the area to learn more about Ruby.
