*update*: "Tinder can listen":/2007/1/27/tinder-listening-is-just-as-important-as-speaking

*update*: Tinder is now available as a gem from rubyforge. Check out "http://rubyforge.org/projects/tinder":http://rubyforge.org/projects/tinder for more information.

For a project that I'm currently working, the client wants to be able provide live chat to its users. So, instead of re-inventing the wheel, we decided to try to use "Campfire":http://campfirenow.com.  The only problem is that I need to be able to create and destroy chat rooms automatically, and Campfire doesn't have an API.

"Caboo.se":http://caboo.se has done some work on a "Campfire bot called Marshmallow":http://www.caboo.se/articles/2006/04/14/meet-marshmallow-the-campfire-bot but the code repository is unavailable.  And, it doesn't seem to allow you to create and delete rooms.

So, introducing Tinder, an API for interfacing with Campfire:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'tinder'
campfire = Tinder::Campfire.new 'mysubdomain'
campfire.login 'myemail@example.com', 'mypassword'
room = campfire.create_room 'New Room', 'My new campfire room to test tinder'
room.speak 'Hello world!'
room.paste File.read("path/to/your/file.txt")
room.destroy
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Install

<pre>
gem install tinder
</pre>

You can get the source from:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/collectiveidea/tinder.git
</pre>

Tinder can also be installed as a gem or a rails plugin.

<pre>
script/plugin install git://github.com/collectiveidea/tinder.git
</pre>

Thanks to "Zach Dennis":http://continuousthinking.com for the name. Feedback and patches are welcome!
