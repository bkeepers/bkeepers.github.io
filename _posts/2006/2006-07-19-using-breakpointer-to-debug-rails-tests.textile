<p>I played with <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoDebugWithBreakpoint">breakpointer</a> for a few minutes to check it out when I was first learning Rails, but I've never actually used it for serious debugging.  But yesterday I had a unit test that was failing and I could not figure why, so I decided I would try it out. I discovered that breakpointer works really well for debugging tests! I had only used it in the context of debugging actions.</p>

<p>Using the breakpointer is really easy, just insert <code>breakpoint</code> at any point in your code. When you run your tests, it will open up an <code>irb</code> session whenever it encounters a <code>breakpoint</code> in your code.</p>

<pre>
.....Executing break point at ./test/unit/event_test.rb:36 in `test_duration'
irb(test_duration_with_hash=(EventTest)):001:0&gt;
</pre>
