<p>A <a href="http://www.quiznos.com/commercials/2006/tv-spot03.asp">recent</a> <a href="http://www.quiznos.com/tv_commercials.asp">Quiznos commercial</a> puts patents and "intellectual property" into perspective. How many companies or even industries wouldn't exist if they had to deal with the patent gauntlet?</p>

<p>Here is the transcript of the commercial:</p>

<blockquote>
Dear Quiznos,

We the undersigned ask you to cease and desist sale of your new smokehouse brisket sub because it encroaches on our long established recipes and intellectual property. Please comply forthwith.

Thank You
</blockquote>
