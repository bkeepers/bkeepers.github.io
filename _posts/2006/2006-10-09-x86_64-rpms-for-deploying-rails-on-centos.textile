I've built "RPMs for deploying Apache 2.2 + Mongrel":/2006/08/02/rpms-for-deploying-rails-on-centos/ on x86_64 CentOS. "Download([i] Collective Idea yum configuration file for CentOS 4)":http://source.collectiveidea.com/pub/linux/centos/4/x86_64/ci.repo the yum config to <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/</code>.  Check out the "post about the 32bit RPMS":http://opensoul.org/2006/08/02/rpms-for-deploying-rails-on-centos/ for more information.
