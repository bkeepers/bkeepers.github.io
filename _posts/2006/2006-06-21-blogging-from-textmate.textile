<p>Amazingly, this blog post was created using the latest version of <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>.  It has an <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/06/19/blogging-from-textmate/">incredible new bundle</a> that uses the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">MetaWeblog API</a> for for blogging to Drupal, Moveable Type, Type, Wordpress, and more.  Maybe now I'll blog more since it's so easy (yeah, right).

</p><p><b>update:</b> unfortunately wordpress doesn't understand Textile.  I'll have to fix that.</p>
