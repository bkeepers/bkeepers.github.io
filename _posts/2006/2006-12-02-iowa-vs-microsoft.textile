	"Des Moines lawyer Roxanne Conlin will present her class-action lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. as a series of nine stories designed to show how Microsoft harmed Iowa consumers by destroying competition...in what is already one of the longest civil cases in Iowa history and what is expected to be one of the longest court battles, lasting several months. To win the case and the $330 million in damages that she is seeking, Conlin will have to show that Microsoftâ€™s actions resulted in overcharges to Iowa consumers." - "Des Moines Register":http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061201/BUSINESS/61201016/1001/NEWS
