Recently I had a client who wanted to store server backups on their hosting provider's FTP server. The only problem is that those backups contained confidential customer data. So I came up with the idea of using a public GPG key to encrypt backups before copying them to the FTP server.

A little searching revealed that a lot of other people have also used this method. A great guide for getting set up to do this can be found <a title="Notes for using GPG to encrypt and decrypt backup files" href="http://www.somacon.com/p107.php">here</a>.

I already had a GPG key pair, so all I had to do was import my public key on the server, change the trust settings, and write a few bash scripts to dump the DB, create an encrypted tar archive, and FTP it.

Here are the commands I used to encrypt the database dump and tar archive:
<pre># dump PostgreSQL data and encrypt it
pg_dump dbname | gpg -r C0E3268C -e -o /tmp/backup.sql.gpg

# tar the directories I want to backup and encrypt them
tar -c /var /etc | gpg -r C0E3268C -e -o /tmp/backup.tar.gpg</pre>
