JavaScript is no longer a toy language. Many of our applications can't function without it. If we are going to use JavaScript to do real things, we need to treat it like a real language, adopting the same practices we use with real languages.

This framework agnostic talk takes a serious look at how we develop JavaScript applications. Despite its prototypical nature, good object-oriented programming principles are still relevant. The design patterns that we've grown to know and love work just as well in JavaScript as they do any other language. Test driven development forces us to write modular, decoupled code.
