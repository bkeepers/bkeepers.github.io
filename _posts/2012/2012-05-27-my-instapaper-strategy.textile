*tl;dr*: I have found a strategy that leads to Instapaper bliss: sort articles by oldest-first.

"Instapaper":http://instapaper.com/ is wonderful. Besides "Tweetbot":http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/, it is the most used app on my iPad. It is a gorgous app that makes reading so enjoyable. Anytime someone sends me a link that I can't read in 2 minutes, I save it to Instapaper to save for that glorious Saturday when I just lay in the hammock and read all afternoon. It's my very own personal New York Times, Wired, and Sherlock Holmes, all rolled into one.

But Instapaper also *causes me quite a bit of strife*, because that glorious Saturday afternoon rarely comes. I can't keep up with the backlog.  Over the last 2 years, I've collected hundreds of long form articles that taunt me every time I open the app. So I typically open it up, read the latest article or two, and then get disgusted by all the amazing things that I don't have time to read. A better man might be able to simply ignore that backlog, but it drives me insane.

A few months ago, while exploring Instapaper's settings to find the ideal font (let's be honest, I was overwhelmed by how many unread articles there were, so I was procrastinating), I *switched the default sorting* from "newest-first" to "oldest-first". I don't think I expected much to change because of it, but it had an interesting side effect.

There are now only about 20 unread articles in my instapaper queue. I haven't been reading more lately. I've actually been reading less. But I've been reading smarter.  Here are my theories as to why this simple change had such an impact:

* We're all addicted to new. Our brains secret some good endorphines when we're riding the wave. But _new_ does not always equal _better_. By showing oldest articles first, the farther I get behind on Instapaper, the less timely the content is. I now spend more time reading "timeless" articles, and I simply delete the ones that are no longer relevant.
* The disire for _new_ still exists, and acts as an incentive to keep up to date.
* Sometimes I read things I don't care about simply because I like the person that recommended it to me. But when I'm looking at articles on Instapaper that are 6 months old, I don't remember who recommended. So I'm more likely to skip stuff that I don't care about.

It's a small thing, but I love small life hacks that streamline my life.
