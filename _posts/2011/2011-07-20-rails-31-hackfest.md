Rails 3.1 is just around the corner, and this weekend Rubyists will be convening in real and virtual worlds for the [Rails 3.1 hackfest](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/7/14/rails-3-1-hackfest).

We all spend a little too much time by ourselves staring at screens, so why don't we get together and have a little awkward social interaction? I invite anyone in the greater West Michigan area to come hang out and work on upgrading your project to Rails 3.1, hack on gems and plugins, or submit patches to Rails.

**Where**: Collective Idea, [25 West 8th Street, Suite 200, Holland, Michigan](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25+West+8th+Street,+Suite+200,+Holland,+MI)
**When**: Saturday, July 23, 2011 â€” anytime between 10am-6pm

We will be getting a keg of beer and ordering some pizza for lunch, so please bring some money to chip in. Let me know in the comments if you're planning on coming so we have an idea of how many people to expect.

If you can't make it in person, we'll be hanging out on Campfire.
