"Lucid":https://github.com/bkeepers/lucid is a JavaScript framework I am creating which encapsulates ideas from several large JavaScript applications. I'm sure I'll be writing about it more as it matures, but for now I want to highlight a commit I made tonight.

I've been looking for a way to integrate "JSLint":http://www.jslint.com/ (or "JSHint":http://jshint.com/, a slightly more sane version of JSLint) into the "build process" of my JavaScript-heavy apps, and it recently occurred to me that it should just be part of the test suite.

I've been using "Jasmine":https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine a lot lately, and it was rather trivial to add a "spec that runs all my src and spec files through JSHint":https://github.com/bkeepers/lucid/blob/master/spec/javascripts/z_jshint_spec.js. Now I can immediately see where I have poor syntax:
