Over on the "Pro Git blog":http://progit.org/2010/08/25/notes.html, Scott Chacon shows us how to add notes to our git commits without changing the commit SHA.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git notes add -m 'Neat feature in git to add notes to commits'
{% endhighlight %}

I'd love to see GitHub come up with something clever to use it for.  Maybe store comments on commits from GitHub's web interface as a note so they can be viewed locally.
