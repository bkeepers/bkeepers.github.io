I am thrilled to announce that I am now a GitHubber. Check out the official announcements on both the [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/993-ordered-list-is-a-githubber) and ~<sub>Ordered\\ List</sub>~ blogs.

When I joined Ordered List, we had grand plans of building a great company on the back of some amazing products. GitHub is already doing that, so when the opportunity came to join forces with them, I had almost no hesitation.

Personally, I look forward to bringing the [products](http://speakerdeck.com) [we](http://get.gaug.es) [built](http://get.harmonyapp.com) and the experiences we gained building them to make GitHub even better. GitHub has an [amazing team](https://github.com/about) and I cannot wait to inspire and be inspired by them.
