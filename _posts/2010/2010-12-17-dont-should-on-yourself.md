I have developed the terrible habit of shoulding on myself: I *should* do that; I *should* blog more; I *should* return his phone call; I *should* finish that project; I *should* clean the office.

*Should* is a dangerous word. It conveys a sense of obligation. Failure to follow through with things you *should* do leads to guilt. Guilt is demotivating.

*Should* kills discipline. It allows you to entertain the notion of doing something without committing to it. It tempts you to procrastinate the things you want and need to do do.

Replace "**should**" with "**will**" or "**will not**". Don't *should* on yourself.
