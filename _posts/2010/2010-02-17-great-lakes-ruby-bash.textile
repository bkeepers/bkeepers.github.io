The "Great Lakes Ruby Bash":http://greatlakesrubybash.com/ is now accepting talk proposals.  The conference will be held on Michigan State University's campus in East Lansing, Michigan on Saturday, April 17th.

We're looking for passionate speakers to give 25 and 40 minute presentations about their experiences with Ruby and related technologies. Our goal is to engage attendees and inspire them to create great software, empower users, and continue learning with others.

Proposals are due *Feb 28th, 2010 at 12:59pm EST*. We hope to have all proposals reviewed and speakers chosen by March 8th, 2010. "Visit the website":http://greatlakesrubybash.com/ for more info.

h3. Sponsors

We are also looking for companies and freelancers to sponsor the event. This year's conference will be the third Ruby conference in this region.  The previous two conferences attracted 60-70 attendees each. As a result of more interest, greater community involvement, and a more aggressive marketing campaign, we are anticipating 100-150 attendees this year.
