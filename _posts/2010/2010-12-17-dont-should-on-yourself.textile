I have developed the terrible habit of shoulding on myself: I _should_ do that; I _should_ blog more; I _should_ return his phone call; I _should_ finish that project; I _should_ clean the office.

_Should_ is a dangerous word. It conveys a sense of obligation. Failure to follow through with things you _should_ do leads to guilt. Guilt is demotivating.

_Should_ kills discipline. It allows you to entertain the notion of doing something without committing to it. It tempts you to procrastinate the things you want and need to do do.

Replace "*should*" with "*will*" or "*will not*". Don't _should_ on yourself.
