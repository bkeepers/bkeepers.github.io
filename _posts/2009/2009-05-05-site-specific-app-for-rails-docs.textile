Unless you're a Rails genius, you probably need to frequently reference the Rails API docs. And if you haven't discovered it yet, "railsapi.com":http://railsapi.com is awesome.

"John Nunemaker":http://railstips.org suggested that I create a site-specific browser and point it to a local copy of the docs from "railsapi.com":http://railsapi.com.  I did and have been loving it, so I'm suggesting that you do it too.

"Download Fluid":http://fluidapp.com/ (or the comparable app for your platform if you're not on a Mac).  Then download a copy of the docs from "railsapi.com":http://railsapi.com and create a new app pointing to that local copy.

Better yet, head over to "railslogo.com":http://railslogo.com and grab the Creative Commons licensed logo to use as the icon.

Now my only complaint is that I don't have docs for Ruby and other gems in this app, but I have a hunch that it won't be long until that changes.
