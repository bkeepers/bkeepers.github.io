"Transparency", "participation", and "collaboration" are considered the core principles of open source. When we talk about applying open source to other realms of society–like government and data–we’re talking bringing transparency to the processes that govern those realms, enabling people to participate in whatever way they can, and giving them the tools and space to collaborate.

This talk examines how our internal engineering teams can learn open source principles from the communication structure of open source communities.
