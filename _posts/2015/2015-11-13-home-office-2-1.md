title: Home Office 2.1

I've worked from home in some form since 2005. My home office is generally reserved for productive activities, which makes it a space that I go when I need to focus. I decided to give it a little makeover last year to make it a place that is a little more inspiring.

## The coffee table started it all.

I came across a wooden shipping crate last year while looking for some scrap lumber for another project. I decided a shipping crate was an apt material for the furniture that I use to ship software.

Not sure how well it would work out in practice, I decided to build a coffee table first.

When I can't concentrate or am working on a hard problem, changing location helps me make the mental shift. I wanted some comfortable chairs to lounge in whenever I needed a change of scenery. I founds some slightly modern looking chairs to pull together the rustic palette furniture with the bright green walls and electronics.

The chairs also serve as a good place to sit and jam on the guitar or mandolin.

## The standing desk.

I've had various iterations of a [homemade standup desk](/2012/01/09/the-40-standup-desk/) for the past several years. For my new office, I decided to build a new desk out of pallets. I was on the lookout for businesses getting rid of pallets as I drove around town. Within a few days I had more than enough to build it.

> Protip: Breaking down old pallets is incredibly boring. Buy a good audiobook to keep you entertained.

I assembled the desktop out of boards from various pallets to give it some good variance, and then aged all the wood using science ([tea, steel wool, and vinegar](http://www.instructables.com/id/tea-staining/)).

I am pretty happy with how it turned out. I don't love the legs, but they are replaceable whenever I come up with a better design.

## A day at the chalkboard wall.

I spend all day on a computer, typically doing things that are not terribly creative. I'm not a designer, but I've always appreciated good design and enjoyed the process of designing. So, I decided to make one wall of my office a chalkboard to give myself a creative outlet.

My nieces enjoy the chalkboard wall when they visit, but my work buddy pictured above is not impressed. The design is stolen from [this beautiful dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/982499-Not-all-who-wander-are-lost).

Here's a time-lapse of my first day at the chalkboard:

> Protip: If you're going to turn a wall into a chalkboard, run a sander over it first. My wall had a slight texture to it, which makes it a little difficult to draw on with chalk.

## Wall map

I've had the privilege to travel to some cool places. I've always wanted a wall map to put pins on the significant places. [stickerbrand.com](http://stickerbrand.com/products/vinyl-wall-decal-sticker-world-map-with-pin-drops-873) has nice ones in various sizes.

## That's all for now

I'm still on the lookout for a stool to go with the standing desk. I'm looking at the [HAG Capisco chair](http://www.ergodepot.com/HAG_Capisco_p/8106.htm). Hit me up on twitter if you have any questions or suggestions.
