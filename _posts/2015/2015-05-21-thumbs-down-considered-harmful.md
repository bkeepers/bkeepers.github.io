The cardinal rule of improv is to never say "No". You carry the story foward by responding with "Yes, andâ€¦".

Emoji are awesome for allowing us to add emotion to complex communication. When used propery, they can effectively nuance the tone of intense conversations.

But there is one emoji I have vowed to never use again: ðŸ‘Ž.

Generally, when expressing disapproval of an idea, we list the reasons and identify what about the idea would have to change for our opinion to change. Others participating in the conversation


"To me YES, AND means donâ€™t be afraid to contribute. Itâ€™s your responsibility to contribute. Always make sure youâ€™re adding something to the discussion. Your initiations are worthwhile."
