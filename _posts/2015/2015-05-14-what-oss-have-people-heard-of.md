Someone asked me this week: "What are some examples of open source software that most people have heard of?" I had a few answers off the top of my head, but not nearly enough. Anyone that uses a computer likely interacts with hundreds of open source components every day.

What other open source projects are popular among common folks? [Add your suggestion][pr].

## [Mozilla Firefox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a web browser that descended from [Netscape Navigator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator), which was released as open source in the late 90s.

## [Google Chrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome)

[Google's popular web browser](http://www.google.com/chrome/) is developed as open source software under the name [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/). It was  originally based on the the [same code that powers Apple's Safari](https://www.webkit.org/) web browser.

## [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/)

Linux-based operating systems powers a good portion of the internet. There are many different distributors of Linux-based operating systems, such as [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), and they are all comprised of the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) and a host of other open source utilities that make up an entire operating system. The Linux Kernel, originally released in 1991, is largely credited with being an early example of the effectiveness of open source.
