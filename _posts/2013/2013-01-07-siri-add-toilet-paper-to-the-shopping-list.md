The Reminders app on iOS and Mac has quickly become one of my favorite apps, mostly due to its integration with Siri and the ability to share lists with my wife.

I almost always have my phone in my hand, so no matter how predisposed I am, I can afford to hold down the home button and say, "Siri, add toilet paper to the shopping list", or "Remind me to turn off the porch light when I get home."

It hasn't been added the Reminders iOS app yet, so many people don't know it exists, but from the Mac app or [iCloud.com](http://icloud.com) you can share a list. The list has to be synced with iCloud for this to work.

Reminders is far from perfect, but it's the only list–paper or otherwise–that I've been able to stick with for more than a week. It offers a glimpse of what the future holds for reminder and todo apps—and takes me one step closer to being completely useless without my phone.
